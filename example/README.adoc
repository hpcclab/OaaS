== Introduction
In the example usages, we provide the example scripts to show how to deploy the application and invoke the function in OaaS. The example scripts begin with creating the class and its function, then constructing objects based on the given class. Then, we show how to use the Object Access Interface to request the state data or invoke a function. The full scripts are provided inside an HTTP directory.

NOTE: Object Controller has an auto-generated link:../doc/oc/openapi.yaml[OpenAPI document]. Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the OpenAPI document to user-friendly format, you can look at it on this external link:https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawissanutt/OaaS/main/doc/oc/openapi.json[link].

== Text Object
This section will explain how to use OaaS via using the text object as an example. The text object only have a single function that is string concatenation. Each text object represents a single text file.

=== Creating the class and its function


[source,http request]
----
POST http://<object-controller>/api/batch
Content-Type: text/x-yaml

functions:
  - name: example.text.concat
    type: TASK
    outputCls: example.text
    validation: {}
    provision:
      knative:
        image: ghcr.io/hpcclab/oaas/concat-function:sc22
#        concurrency: 256
        minScale: 1
#        maxScale: 10
        requestsCpu: '0.25'
        limitsCpu: '2'
classes:
  - name: example.text
    stateType: FILE
    objectType: SIMPLE
    stateSpec:
      keySpecs:
        - name: text
    functions:
      - access: PUBLIC
        function: example.text.concat
----

=== Creating an object
//Creating an object requires two steps:

. Submitting an object specification to Object Controller. We have to specify the class of a new object on `cls`. In this case, we are going to upload a text file into this object, so we have to specify the `keys` variable to ask Object Controller to generate the URL for uploading in the next step.
+
[source,http request]
----
POST http://<object-controller>/api/object-construct
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "cls": "example.text",
  "keys": ["text"],
}
----
+
Object Controller will reply with the detail of a new object and the URL to upload the state data.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "object": {
    "id": "fc110a1f-0d9c-407a-8c64-36bf6d0870c9",
    "origin": {
      "rootId": "fc110a1f-0d9c-407a-8c64-36bf6d0870c9"
    },
    "access": "PUBLIC",
    "cls": "example.text",
    "state": {
      "type": "FILES"
    }
  },
  "uploadUrls": {
    "text": "http://s3.10.131.36.40.nip.io/msc-bkt/fc110a1f-0d9c-407a-8c64-36bf6d0870c9/text?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=XYV0GB00VOPBNFKOIHSP%2F20220412%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220412T002046Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7c05dfdd8279cfd9cf5a2a941c408a24db0f13d310849de7997ed8a8b2f4d195"
  }
}
----

. Uploading the state data to the URL given by step 1.
+
[source,http request]
----
PUT <<uploadUrls.text>>
Content-Type: text/plain

<<TEXT_FILE_DATA>>
----

=== Requesting an object state data

You can request the state data of any object via requesting to Content Delivery Service as the following example.
//Content Delivery Service will reply with the object state data of given object ID.
[source,http request]
----
GET http://<content-delivery-service>/<object_id>/text
----

=== Invoking a function

With the Object Access Interface, we can also request the function invocation and wait for the state data of the output object.

[source,http request]
----
GET http://<content-delivery-service>/<object_id>:concat()(APPEND=NEW_TEXT)/text
----
