== Available built-in Functions

=== builtin.logical.new
`builtin.logical.new` is a function for creating object. When running the command `ocli object create`, the command will call `new` function.

NOTE: If the class doesn't have `new` function, object cannot be created via `ocli object create`.

=== builtin.logical.update
`builtin.logical.update` is a function for updating the object data from request body.

[source,bash]
----
oprc invoke update -d '{"name":"john","surname":"doe"}'
# the object data will be set to {"name":"john","surname":"doe"}
----

=== builtin.logical.file
`builtin.logical.file` is a function for generating a presign URL for unstructured data. When running the command `ocli object file`, the command will call `file` function.
NOTE: If the class doesn't have `new` function, you cannot load file in object via `ocli object file` or `ocli object cat-file`.

=== builtin.logical.get
`builtin.logical.file` is a function that return the output object as the  targeted of this function call. This function is made to be used in the dataflow.

Pseudo code for explanation:
----
obj = new Object()
output = obj.get()
assert output == obj

== Available built-in class

=== builtin.base
The utility class to be inherited from. This class contains a list of built-in functions:

* builtin.logical.new
* builtin.logical.get
* builtin.logical.file
