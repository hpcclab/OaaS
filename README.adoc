== Introduction
=== What is Oparaca?
Oparaca (**O**bject **Para**digm on Serverless **C**loud **A**bstraction) is the implementation of Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) paradigm

=== What is OaaS?

Object as a Service (OaaS) is a new serverless paradigm, that borrows the object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate application logic and data in addition to non-functional requirements (QoS and constraints) into a single deployment package, thereby, streamlining cloud-native application development.
