== Introduction

Object Access Interface is an API provided by OaaS. It allows to  invoke the function and/or access the object state. OAI have two semantics to call this API.

. *Body-Based* with JSON format.
. *Path-Based* with Object Access Langauge (OAL).

The second semantic is more simple, but it will have a problem when you want to send some parameter with unreserved characters.

== Body-Based OAI

The body-based OAI is basically a REST-API style of OAI. You can send the POST request into the content delivery service to access the object. The schema of JSON body can be found at link:doc/tm/openapi.yaml[].

NOTE: Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the OpenAPI document to user-friendly format, you can look at it on this external link:https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawissanutt/OaaS/main/doc/tm/openapi.json[link].

== Path-Based OAI

The path-based OAI is not follow the REST-API style, however, it is still the HTTP request. In this semantic, we design the _Object Access Langauge (OAL)_ to structure the function call and object request on the HTTP path.

----
. An object ID of targeted object.
. A function name to invoke.
. A list of object ID of input objects. The value on this list is delimited by comma.
. A list of key-value pair of the arguments for this function invocation. The value on this list is delimited by comma.
. A state data key name that the client request to OaaS. If the client also issue the function call, OaaS will reply at the completion of this function invocation.


== Example
* Request an object specification
+
[source,http request]
----
GET <content_delivery_service>/<object_id>
----

* Invoking the `concat` function with the argument of `APPEND=NEW_TEXT`. The request will immediately get a response. The client can manually check the completion of function call.

+
*Body-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
POST <content_delivery_service>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target": "<object_id>",
  "functionName": "concat",
  "inputs": [],
  "args": {
    "APPEND": "NEW_TEXT"
  }
}
----
+
*Path-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
GET <content_delivery_service>/<object_id>:concat()(APPEND=NEW_TEXT)
----

* Similar to the previous step but this API will get the `text` file of an output object upon the function invocation is completed.
+
*Body-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
POST <content_delivery_service>/-/text
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target": "<object_id>",
  "functionName": "concat",
  "inputs": [],
  "args": {
    "APPEND": "NEW_TEXT"
  }
}
----
+
*Path-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
GET <content_delivery_service>/<object_id>:concat()(APPEND=NEW_TEXT)/text
----


* Similar to the previous step but this API will send the another object as an input.
+
*Body-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
POST <content_delivery_service>/-/text
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target": "<object_id>",
  "functionName": "concat",
  "inputs": ["<another_object_id>"]
}
----
+
*Path-Based OAI*
+
[source,http request]
----
GET <content_delivery_service>/<object_id>:concat(<another_object_id>)()/text
----
